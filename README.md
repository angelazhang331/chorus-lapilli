# Creating Chorus Lapilli using React

This project uses React, npm, and JavaScript to create a version of the game Chorus Lapilli.
It is made from a base tic-tac-toe game, except each player only has three pieces and pieces must be moved one square at a time.
The center Square of the Board can also only be occupied for one turn, meaning the player must move that piece or win on the next turn.
